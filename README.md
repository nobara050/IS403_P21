# Time Series Prediction Project

## Overview
This project implements and compares various deep learning and machine learning models for time series prediction, including LSTM, ResNet, and SVR approaches.

## Methodology
The project employs several state-of-the-art models for time series forecasting:

- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks
- ResNet (Residual Neural Network)
- SVR (Support Vector Regression)
- ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)

## Results
The models were evaluated using various performance metrics and visualization techniques:
